The selection of the said period was due to the impact of the New Upgrade. The efficiency of the New Upgrade had improved the number of issues logged and resolution time, as portrayed in Section 3. As a result, modeling done before the new upgrade was launched will be inaccurate.\n","However, the limitation to the selected period was a short duration of 17 months, where it may not contain sufficient data to develop a robust model. Thus, we have split our dataset into two parts to validate the model; a training dataset extracted from the period December 2019 to January 2021 (14 months) and test dataset from February to April 2021 (3 months). The objective is on the prediction for the following 3 months.\n","<br><br>\n","## 4.2.\tTime Series Modeling – All Countries\n","On our dataset, multiple time series modeling was performed in order to attain the best fit time series model for prediction. The majority of the model did not perform well in terms of issue prediction. The complete list may be found in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2, where the graphs in Appendix 2 illustrate how the predicted values were unable to fit our test values.\n","<br><br>\n","### 4.2.1.\tExponential Smoothing – Holt’s\n","We ran Holt’s Smoothing model on a monthly basis for the training dataset, with a prediction to fit the test dataset. The graph illustrates the prediction line in blue, while the actual test dataset was in red. The predicted value and trend of the slope are different compared to our test dataset. Hence, Holt’s smoothing method is not suited for our dataset.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"5312ARWzvaFY"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["```{r Time Series - All Country - Exponential Smoothing - Holts}\n","# Train the time series model by using exponential smoothing - Holt's and Holt's Winter method\n","\n","# Data by month:\n","# plot the data to check the trend and seasonality\n","total.issue=month.2019$total\n","plot(total.issue,type = \"o\")\n","# there is trend component as shown in the graph "],"metadata":{"id":"R3O3J444CBI7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=143_vKv6sqspnPT-5QYHU8JvULoftGxni\" width=\"400\" />"],"metadata":{"id":"HcR7gj5UCWXr"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create model by [Exponential Smoothing - Holt's] method\n","# Run for train set\n","holts.training1 <- holt(holts.training,h=3)\n","autoplot(forecast(holts.training1))\n","summary(holts.training1) "],"metadata":{"id":"3-XWTgtzCsc_"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=144ybsh20hbuzjpBQW5MmFl6JyUBV4Fdh\" width=\"400\" />\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1476YgQwRLaU_MPeELW5s9pJbL4Z7vYY4\" width=\"400\" />\n"],"metadata":{"id":"qCp6Du4YC4Ns"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Validate the train set with test set \n","holts.training1 %>% forecast(h = 3) %>% autoplot() +\n","  autolayer(holts.test)             \n","# From the graph, the predicted value from train set is not fit to test set.
