The selection of the said period was due to the impact of the New Upgrade. The efficiency of the New Upgrade had improved the number of issues logged and resolution time, as portrayed in Section 3. As a result, modeling done before the new upgrade was launched will be inaccurate.\n","However, the limitation to the selected period was a short duration of 17 months, where it may not contain sufficient data to develop a robust model. Thus, we have split our dataset into two parts to validate the model; a training dataset extracted from the period December 2019 to January 2021 (14 months) and test dataset from February to April 2021 (3 months). The objective is on the prediction for the following 3 months.\n","<br><br>\n","## 4.2.\tTime Series Modeling – All Countries\n","On our dataset, multiple time series modeling was performed in order to attain the best fit time series model for prediction.
