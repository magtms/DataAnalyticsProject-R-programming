The comparison period was from July 2018 to May 2021, which was extracted based on 17 months before and after the new implementation in December 2019. From Graph 5, we were able to determine that the average number of issues logged in Mainland China had a significant drop of 49.5%, from 2,134 to 1,078 issues per month. We were then able to deduce, in the aspect of the number of issues, that the new upgrade had effectively reduced the number of issues logged via issue tracking software.\n","\n","On the contrary, the median number of issues in Hong Kong had surged by 113.6%, from 433 to 925 issues per month. This was out of expectations, bearing in mind the purpose of the new upgrade. The rise in the number of issues was reasonably caused by the spike in the number of issues in November 2020, whereby it had the highest number of issues logged at 1,811. \n","\n","To explain the unexpected increase after the new upgrade launch, we had engaged with the business stakeholders to obtain further insights. The cause of the spike in November 2020 was triggered by a system migration project for one of the software application taking place in Hong Kong.\n","\n","Additionally, some of the resources in Mainland China, such as the software testers, were moved to support the system migration in Hong Kong. Therefore, it can be observed in Graph 5 that there was a slight drop in cases in Mainland China during the same period as well.\n","\n","Despite the increase in the monthly average number of issues in Hong Kong, the monthly average number of issues in Mainland China and Hong Kong combined had decreased by 22.0%.\n","<br><br>\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"WmXuU7TwMg3W"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 3.2. Relationship between Number of Issues vs Number of Projects\n","\n","In Graph 3 in Phase 1, it was mentioned that the trend between the number of issues and projects seems to be correlated.

This suggests that the assumption of a linear relationship was valid, the residuals exhibit normal random noise. \n","\n","The regression analysis model had proven that there is a significant impact between the number of issues and project, which means the change in number of project will bring a signficant change to number of issue. With this, the decreasing trend of number of issue in Graph 5 may not only be impacted by the new upgrade, it may due to the reduction of number of project as well. Therefore, we have move further to normalize the number of issue with the number of project, to see if the number of issue per project change along with the new upgrade.
