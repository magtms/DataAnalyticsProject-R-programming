Data Collection\n","\n","The data obtained in this study was internal data extracted from the company's issue tracking software. The data owner is the IT Support Team and information recorded is based on all projects from a few of the operation systems (application). Dataset supplied spanned 4.5 years, from 29 October 2016 to 12 May 2021. This provides us with 17 months of data after the new update launched at 1 December 2019. \n","\n","There had been a total of 304 projects and 176,299 issues logged throughout the given time period. There are 10 variables extracted to be used for this current study, further information pertaining to the variables can be found in the data dictionary under Table 1.\n","<br><br>\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=13QwUPVHu3m8u_aNYzd5DZVI60Fhy2Y7-\" width=\"550\" />\n","\n","*Table 1: Table of Data Dictionary.*\n","<br><br>\n","Other than the provided variables, we believe securing the nature of the project logged would aid us in analysing the trend of issues as an increase in project complexity and functionality enhancement is expected to increase the number of issues occurring. Furthermore, an understanding of issue resolution would also reveal the issue’s complexity, hence increasing resolution time and impacting the resources required to resolve other existing issues. Nonetheless, due to data confidentiality, these information was withheld.\n","<br><br>\n","# 2. Data Exploratory Analysis\n","\n","The statistics provided from Chart 2 revealed Mainland China, with the highest number, 88,200, of issues logged between the period of 01 January 2016 and 12 May 2021. Hong Kong was second at 28,800, followed by Japan (12,500), Taiwan (6,300) and Korea (6,000). The volume of the remaining countries was insignificant for the current study. \n","\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=13KPWasIkR1qtu-vlykdcTrfJ6dr4qkbc\" width=\"550\" />\n","\n","*Chart 2: Total Number of Issues Raised from the year 2016 to May 2021 (by Country Level).*\n","\n","<br><br>\n","\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=13LSX6LcyJxE04TRJvEy5fzh0v9MqRofk\" width=\"550\" />\n","\n","*Graph 3: Plot of the Number of Issues and Projects from January 2016 to May 2021.*\n","\n","Graph 3 illustrates the number of issues and projects on a country level over a span of 4.5 years, from January 2016 to May 2021. On a general outlook, it depicts an increasing trend until 2018 and a downward trend thereafter. This was reflected by both number of issues and projects.\n","\n","<br><br>\n","\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=13PO-otEEme7LQArC0Lp8feav3OmgbOlP\" width=\"550\" />\n","\n","*Graph 4: Plot of the Number of Issues at the Country Level from January 2016 to May 2021.*\n","\n","To obtain more insights, Graph 4 was plotted based on a number of issues at the country level. The illustration demonstrates Mainland China having the highest number of issues which peaked at 3,567 issues in June 2018. Following new update, there is a notable drop after December 2019. \n","Hong Kong, on the other hand, had a smaller degree of fluctuations till the year 2020 whereby the number of issues spikes to 1,811 issues in November 2020. Thereafter, the number of issues declined.\n","The remaining countries had minimal fluctuations as the majority of the operation were in either Mainland China or Hong Kong. \n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"3sC44xA6cVn-"}}]}
