Conclusion\n","The current study had 2 objectives. Firstly, it was to assess the effectiveness of the New Upgrade implemented in December 2019. Secondly, predicting the trend of the number of issues in the subsequent 3 months.\n","\n","The New Upgrade was launched to increase the efficiency of the operation. Based on our evaluation, there had been a combined reduction of 22.0% for China and Hong Kong for the number of issues logged on a monthly basis. This was despite a 113.6% increase for Hong Kong. In terms of per project basis, there had been a 39.9% decrease and a 110.5% increase in the number of issues. This was accounted for by the system migration project in Hong Kong. Aside from that, the number of issues had dropped in the 17 months after the New Upgrade was launched.\n","\n","The launched of New Upgrade was also deemed effective in terms of resolution time. A quick resolution time will benefit the project team, allowing them to move faster toward project completion. When it comes to critical factors for project completion, the overall reduction in resolution time was 41.8%, with 35.3%, 31.9%, and 33.35% reductions in Bug, Critical, and High Level, respectively.\n","\n","Moving on to the prediction on the trend of issues for the next 3 months for all countries, there was a predicted decrease for subsequent two months by 1.8% and 3.8% before an increase of 1.9% to 4,144 number of issues by the third month, July 2021. With an effective launched of New Upgrade, a decrease in the prediction of the number of issues was expected. Nonetheless, past data had shown fluctuations happening within the 17 monthsâ€™ time frame. The fluctuation which was due to seasonality behaviours, may had caused the unexpected increase in number of issues, since it was a short prediction period of 3 months.\n","\n","Following the forecast for the next three months for China, there was a predicted reduction of 1.8% and 3.8% for the next two months before an increase of 1.9% to 4,144 issues by the third month, July 2021. A decrease in the predicted number of issues was expected with the launched of New upgrade. Nonetheless, previous data indicated that changes occurred within the 17 month time range. Due to the short prediction period of three months, the volatility induced by seasonality behaviors may have resulted in an unexpected increase in the number of difficulties.\n","\n","A longer training dataset will be necessary to improve the accuracy of our prediction. The Box and Jenkins approach advised a minimum of 50 observations. The current study employed 14 months of training data and 3 months of test data since that was the longest period we could secure after the New Upgrade was launched.\n","<br><br>\n"],"metadata":{"id":"zL1mV-gvRc0R"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 6. Recommendation\n","A more effective time series model and prediction outcome can be achieved by securing an updated data, this would provide more observation points for an accurate prediction. Additionally, the number of projects, which had significant impact on the number of issues, should have been taken into consideration in the time series model. A Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Exogenous (SARIMAX) or a multivariate time series model are two examples of such time series modeling.\n","\n","Other than prediction of number of issues, more in-depth analysis may be conducted if the nature of the project and detailed resolution is provided.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"H41_WlfBSgBB"}}]}
